                    <p> Creating a website like this for my final project creates a vast majority of opportunities for me to broaden my horizons in social media. I have created a couple of platforms where 
                        I can showcase what I can do such as a YouTube channel, a Twitch.tv channel, and an Instagram business page where I can show off different promotional opportunities.</p>

                    <p> I plan to implement all the technical skills I will learn from Bow Valley College and the self-education I have been doing on my own, into a company in Vancouver, BC or Los Angeles, CA. 
                        I have currently been working at Champs Sports Canada for the last 5 years as an Assistant Manager. Working in retail has taught me a lot about working in a team environment. I have also 
                        learned how to become a leader and strive for the best in everyone I am working with. Learning these attributes early in my career gives me an advantage in working with different people and 
                        getting the job done. </p>
